          Why outsource for general surgery medical billing and coding?
        </h2>
        <p>
          General surgery medical billing is complicated for many reasons and
          should be done by a professional medical billing company.
        </p>
        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Evaluation and management coding:</h3>
        <p>
          In the field of general surgery E/M coding is very confusing. Patients
          usually visit doctors for examination and then go for the surgery. So
          in some cases the initial doctor visit is coded separately and
          performed surgery is coded separately. In other cases both are coded
          combinedly. A medical billing company can deal with these types of
          problems professionally and efficiently.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Under-coding:</h3>
        <p>
          In general surgery a patient may go through many processes and have to
          visit multiple practitioners. In this scenario it is very important to
          document all the visits and procedures. Because if a provider fails to
          code them properly it will cause them loss in revenue because these
          procedures are costly. Plus it is also called under-billing and that
          is against the law.
        </p>
        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Global surgery coding:</h3>
        <p>
          Global surgery includes all the services provided before, during and
          after surgery. These services are not coded separately but they are
          coded according to various packages. Outsourcing is the best option
          for dealing with this.
