          Limitations on coverage of pathology lab services:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Pathology labs are facing limitations and restrictions issues
          nowadays. Many payers don’t cover maximum pathology lab services. Many
          insurance companies have pin down the numbers of providers, especially
          pathology labs. In this case it is very difficult to get the payments
          from insurance companies or patients. The only thing that pathology
          labs can do about these limitations is to do proper documentation and
          reporting. You need to confirm the coverage before providing services.
