          Podiatry Billing and Coding Challenges
        </h2>

          consists of a wide range of complexities as compared to medical
          billing for other medical fields. Understandably, struggling with such
          changing policies can be very frustrating for the providers. But, with

          Coding Fails to Distinguish Medically Necessary from Routine
        </h3>
        <p>
          Payers usually don’t cover routine care but in the case of podiatry,
          there are some conditions in which the same case requires regular
          checkups. That’s why you need a team of experts for medical billing,
          especially in the case of podiatry. To deal with such situations we
          have a team of experts with years of experience and all the required
          knowledge. Due to this thing, we guarantee you maximum recompenses.

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">
          Inconsistent Use of Modifiers by Payers
        </h3>
        <p>
          Modifiers are the further classification of the CPT codes that
          describe us about the treatment and these modifiers determine whether
          these treatments are covered or not under the current insurance. In
          podiatry medical billing different insurers have different rules for
          coding and billing and due to this reason, every coder and biller
          should know the policies of the insurance companies with which they
          are dealing. So submitting correct claims which are based on the
          correct use of modifiers and consequently payments depend upon the
          correct use of modifiers. Thus selecting the correct medical billing
          company to increase your revenue can be challenging but you don’t need
          to worry PCS is here for you. Contact us today!

          Insurers Bundling Procedures Inappropriately
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most payers tend to bundle the CPT codes to make the billing and
          payments convenient. But at the same time, this bundling can also be a
          cause of incorrect billing, over-coding, or under-coding. That’s why
          medical billing companies for podiatry should be aware of the bundling
          strategies of different and should bill accordingly to avoid denials.
          If in some cases insurer gives the wrong denials medical billing
          should be capable enough of handling that and getting your payment
          back.
        </p>
        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Location Changes Affect Billing</h3>
        <p>
          Podiatric procedures can be performed at places like hospitals,
          clinics, and nursing facilities. Thus modifiers are used accordingly
          and these changing locations can add complexities to the medical
          billing of the podiatric field. So the modifiers chart should be
          updated as using a different code will indicate a different location
          and thus the claim can be denied or rejected until correct information
          is provided.
