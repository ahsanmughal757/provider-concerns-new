          Toxicology lab billing is particularly difficult since billing codes
          are constantly changing, resulting in large reimbursement losses over
          the last few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lab workers frequently struggle to keep up with these frequent
          revisions, therefore outsourcing to a specialist revenue cycle team is
          quite advantageous. Our specialized staff employs cutting-edge
          software and receives ongoing training to remain up to speed on the
          newest billing codes and payer requirements. This guarantees that
          claims are processed promptly and payments are not delayed.

          Efficient billing for toxicology laboratories is dependent on

          patient data and paperwork required to substantiate each claim. Speed
          is of importance; submitting claims soon after the service date
