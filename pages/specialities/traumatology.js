          Many doctors rely on in-house billing for the field of traumatology.
          They specially gets training for coding, But still this process
          requires a lot of time and a doctor can not afford to spend his
          precious time in dealing with coding and billing rather than focusing
          on his patient’s health. Because this is what a doctor loves to do.

          Challenges of traumatology medical billing:
        </h2>
        <p>
          As compared to other medical specialties, traumatology surgery has
          many complications with respect to medical billing. Some are explained
          below:
        </p>
        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">Global surgery issues:</h3>
        <p>
          Same as other surgeries in traumatology surgery; medical billing is
          also complicated because of global surgery packages. Global surgery
          includes services before, during and after the surgery. Surgeons offer
          complete packages for global surgeries. These packages are changed and
          unique for every type of surgery. So coders and billers must be
          experienced in the field of traumatology billing services so that they
          can document correct codes and modifiers. Also there are some
          additional services which are other than the global surgery package
          and are coded separately. Coders must be familiar with coding such
          services.
        </p>

        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">
          Traumatology surgery billing is complicated:
        </h3>
        <p>
          As compared to other surgical practices traumatology surgeries are
          complex because they are in a wide range of variety. Every type of
          service provided must be coded accurately. If any part of service
          remains uncoded it will result in loss of revenue keeping in mind that
          these traumatology surgeries are costly. A provider can not afford
          such losses. So it is necessary that the traumatology billing must be
          handed over to expert and trained coders and billers.
        </p>
        <h3 className="fw-medium fs-5">
          Billing of a surgery performed by multiple surgeons:
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are some surgeries which are performed by a panel of surgeons.
          This panel can consist of surgeons of the same institution and
          sometimes a surgery is performed by a panel of surgeons from different
          organizations. In this scenario medical billing of such surgery
          becomes much more complicated. Because a coder has to remain vigilant
          about duplicate coding.
