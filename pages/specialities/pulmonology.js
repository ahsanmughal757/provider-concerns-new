          patientâ€™s appointment. Unlike other medical fields, scheduling
          appointments in pulmonology is very difficult. It has involved many
          complex treatments or procedures. These procedures require specialists

          are time taking. So a patient has to go through appointment
          rescheduling for several times.

          coder is unable to mention all these relevant details in the claims.

          additional services under modifiers.

          flu shots or any other vaccines. All these seasonal services must be
          recorded. There is much confusion in coverage of these seasonal
          services.

          patients in a day. But pulmonology involves many expensive and costly
          procedures. So every treatment must be coded accurately. An
          inexperienced coder is unable to understand the constantly changing
          CPT and ICD. As a result he may file the claims with errors. Due to
          errors, claims get rejected or denied. It eventually leads to losing a
          high amount of money.
